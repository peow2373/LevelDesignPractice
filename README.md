Goal: Get to your dropship to win, but first you must find the ship key. Avoid the enemies as you progress through the map, you are not allowed to kill them.  
Optional: There are also three alien statues hidden around the map. Can you find them all?

V1: Currently there is no restart option, so when you fall through the map or get stuck, you have to restart the scene to try again. 



Feedback: I was quite pleased when Daniel chose to go right at the start of the game. Going left leads the player along a path that eventually brings them right up to the end, but unable to win. The goal of this level was to subvert expectations, and to appear easier than it truly is. The player only finds the location of the dropship when they go right at the start, so they have to play through the whole level before restarting and being able to complete the level having "unlocked" that information. Even if the player finds the dropship on accident, they still have to find the key, so no matter which path you choose in the beginning, both paths must eventually be explored.
